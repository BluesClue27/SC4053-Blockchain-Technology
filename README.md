   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd prediction-market-dapp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create environment file**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**
   Edit `.env` file with your values:
   ```env
   INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_project_id
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
   ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Network Configuration

The project is configured to work with multiple networks:

- **Local Development**: Hardhat local network

- **BSC Testnet**: Binance Smart Chain test network

### Smart Contract Configuration

Key parameters in the smart contract:
- **Platform Fee**: 2.5% (250 basis points)
- **Minimum Resolution Time**: 1 hour from market creation
- **Maximum Outcomes**: 10 per market
- **Minimum Creation Fee**: 0.001 ETH

## 🚀 Deployment

### Local Deployment

1. **Start local Hardhat network**
   ```bash
   npm run node
   ```

2. **Deploy contract to local network**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:localhost
   ```

### Testnet Deployment

1. **Deploy to Goerli**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:goerli
   ```

2. **Deploy to Sepolia**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:sepolia
   ```

3. **Verify contract (optional)**
   ```bash
   npm run verify:goerli <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
   ```

### Post-Deployment Steps

1. **Update frontend contract address**
   - Copy the deployed contract address from deployment output
   - Update `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `frontend/index.html`

2. **Add contract ABI to frontend**
   - Copy the ABI from `artifacts/contracts/PredictionMarket.sol/PredictionMarket.json`
   - Update `CONTRACT_ABI` in `frontend/index.html`

## 🧪 Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with gas reporting
REPORT_GAS=true npm test

# Run coverage analysis
npm run coverage
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite covers:
- Market creation with various scenarios
- Betting functionality and edge cases
- Market resolution by arbitrators
- Winnings calculation and withdrawal
- Security measures and access controls
- View functions and market queries

## 📱 Usage

### Creating a Market

1. Connect your MetaMask wallet
2. Navigate to "Create Market" tab
3. Fill in market details:
   - Description of the event to predict
   - Possible outcomes (2-10 options)
   - Resolution date and time
   - Arbitrator address (who will resolve the market)
   - Creation fee (minimum 0.001 ETH)
4. Submit transaction

### Placing Bets

1. Browse active markets in "Browse Markets" tab
2. Select an outcome by clicking on it
3. Enter bet amount in ETH
4. Click "Place Bet" and confirm transaction

### Resolving Markets

1. Only designated arbitrators can resolve markets
2. Markets can only be resolved after the resolution time
3. Arbitrator selects the winning outcome
4. All bets are then settled based on the result

### Withdrawing Winnings

1. After market resolution, winners can withdraw their share
2. Winnings are calculated proportionally based on bet amounts
3. Platform fee (2.5%) is deducted from winnings
4. Go to resolved market and click "Withdraw Winnings"
