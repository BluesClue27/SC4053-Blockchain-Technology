See [First-Time Setup Guide](#-first-time-setup-guide) below for detailed step-by-step instructions.

## üöÄ First-Time Setup Guide

### Step 1: Prerequisites Installation

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js (v16 or later)**
   - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Verify installation: `node --version`

2. **MetaMask Browser Extension**
   - Install from [metamask.io](https://metamask.io/)
   - Available for Chrome, Firefox, Brave, and Edge

3. **Python (for frontend server)**
   - Usually comes with Node.js
   - Verify installation: `python --version` or `python3 --version`
   - Alternative: Use Node.js http-server (`npm install -g http-server`)

### Step 2: Project Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SC4053-Blockchain-Technology.git
   cd SC4053-Blockchain-Technology
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will install Hardhat, OpenZeppelin contracts, and all required packages.

### Step 3: MetaMask Configuration

Configure MetaMask to connect to the local Hardhat network:

1. Open MetaMask extension
2. Click the network dropdown at the top
3. Select "Add Network" or "Add a network manually"
4. Enter the following details:
   - **Network Name:** `Localhost 8545`
   - **RPC URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
   - **Chain ID:** `31337`
   - **Currency Symbol:** `ETH`
5. Click "Save"

### Step 4: Import Test Accounts

Hardhat provides 20 pre-funded test accounts (each with 10,000 ETH). You need to import multiple accounts for testing.

**IMPORTANT:** You need at least **5 accounts** total:
- 1 account for creating markets 
- 3 accounts to act as arbitrators (minimum required)
- 1 account for placing bets

**Quick Import - First Account:**

1. In MetaMask, click the account avatar (top right)
2. Select "Import Account"
3. Select "Private Key" as import method
4. **Paste this private key:** `0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80`
5. Click "Import"

This gives you **Account #0** (`0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266`) with 10,000 ETH.

**Import Additional Accounts:**

For a complete list of all 20 available test accounts with their addresses and private keys, see **[TEST_ACCOUNTS.md](./TEST_ACCOUNTS.md)**.

That document includes:
- All 20 test account addresses and private keys
- 4 recommended testing scenarios (basic, multiple markets, complex, and large-scale)
- Step-by-step workflow examples
- Instructions for using accounts as arbitrators or bidders

**Minimum Requirement:** Import at least 3 more accounts (for arbitrators). Import at least 1 accoutn (for placing bets)

### Step 5: Start the Local Environment

You need to open **THREE separate terminal windows**:

**Terminal 1 - Start Local Blockchain:**
```bash
npm run node
```
This starts a local Ethereum blockchain at `http://127.0.0.1:8545`. Keep this terminal running.

**Terminal 2 - Deploy Smart Contract:**
```bash
npm run deploy:localhost
```
This deploys the PredictionMarket contract to your local blockchain.

**IMPORTANT:** Copy the contract address from the output. It will look like:
```
PredictionMarket deployed to: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
```

**Terminal 3 - Start Frontend Server:**
```bash
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8080
```

Alternative using Node.js (if Python is not available):
```bash
npx http-server frontend -p 8080
```

### Step 6: Access the Application

1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
3. MetaMask should prompt you to connect
4. **Switch MetaMask network to "Localhost 8545"**
5. Click "Connect Wallet" button in the application
6. Approve the connection in MetaMask

You should now see:
- Your wallet address displayed
- Your balance (~10,000 ETH)
- Ability to create markets and place bets

### Step 7: Test the Application

#### Create Your First Market

1. Click on the "Create Market" tab
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Description:** "Will it rain tomorrow?"
   - **Outcomes:** Add at least two outcomes (e.g., "Yes", "No")
   - **Resolution Time:** Select a date/time at least 1 minute in the future
   - **Arbitrator Addresses:** Add 3 or more arbitrator addresses
     - Example: Use addresses from Accounts #1, #2, #3 (see [TEST_ACCOUNTS.md](./TEST_ACCOUNTS.md))
     - Can have up to 21 arbitrators
     - If votes tie, market becomes a draw and bets are refunded
   - **Creation Fee:** `0.001` ETH (minimum)
3. Click "Create Market"
4. Confirm the transaction in MetaMask

**Note:** See [TEST_ACCOUNTS.md](./TEST_ACCOUNTS.md) for recommended testing scenarios with specific account assignments.

#### Place a Bet

1. Go to "Browse Markets" tab
2. You should see your newly created market
3. Click on an outcome
4. Enter bet amount (e.g., `0.1` ETH)
5. Click "Place Bet"
6. Confirm transaction in MetaMask

### Stopping the Application

When you're done testing:

1. Press `Ctrl+C` in each of the three terminal windows
2. Close the browser tab
3. MetaMask will automatically disconnect

### Restarting After Shutdown

**IMPORTANT:** When you restart the local blockchain (`npm run node`), it creates a fresh blockchain state. You must:

1. Start the blockchain again (`npm run node`)
2. Deploy the contract again (`npm run deploy:localhost`)
3. Get the new contract address (it may be the same or different)
4. **Reset MetaMask account:**
   - Open MetaMask ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Advanced
   - Click "Clear activity tab data" or "Reset Account"
   - This clears the transaction history for the new blockchain instance

- **Local Development**: Hardhat network (Chain ID: 31337)
- **Localhost**: Local Hardhat node at `http://127.0.0.1:8545`

### Smart Contract Parameters

Key parameters in the PredictionMarket contract:

- **Platform Fee:** 1.5% (150 basis points) - Goes to contract owner
- **Arbitrator Fee:** 1.0% (100 basis points) - Split among arbitrators who voted correctly
- **Total Fees:** 2.5% combined
- **Minimum Resolution Time:** 1 minute from market creation
- **Maximum Outcomes:** 10 per market
- **Minimum Arbitrators:** 3 required
- **Maximum Arbitrators:** 21 allowed
- **Minimum Creation Fee:** 0.001 ETH
- **Voting Mechanism:** Simple majority (more than 50%)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"MetaMask not detected"**
   - Make sure you're accessing via `http://localhost:8080`, not by opening the HTML file directly
   - Ensure MetaMask extension is installed and enabled

2. **"Wrong network" error**
   - Check that MetaMask is connected to "Localhost 8545" network
   - Verify the Chain ID is 31337

3. **"Nonce too high" or transaction errors**
   - Reset MetaMask account: Settings ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Reset Account
   - This happens when you restart the local blockchain

4. **"Contract not deployed" or undefined address**
   - Make sure you ran `npm run deploy:localhost` in Terminal 2
   - Verify the contract address is correct in `frontend/js/app.js`

5. **"Insufficient funds" error**
   - Ensure you imported the test account with 10,000 ETH
   - Check you're connected to the correct account in MetaMask

6. **Python server won't start**
   - Try `python3 -m http.server 8080` instead
   - Or use Node.js: `npx http-server frontend -p 8080`

7. **"Port 8545 already in use"**
   - Another process is using that port
   - Kill the process or restart your computer
   - On Windows: `netstat -ano | findstr :8545` then `taskkill /PID <process_id> /F`

8. **Contract address keeps changing**
   - This is normal when restarting the local blockchain
   - The contract address is deterministic based on deployment order
   - Usually stays the same if you deploy in the same sequence

## üì± Usage

### Creating a Market

1. Connect your MetaMask wallet
2. Navigate to "Create Market" tab
3. Fill in market details:
   - Description of the event to predict
   - Possible outcomes (2-10 options)
   - Resolution date and time
   - Arbitrator address (who will resolve the market)
   - Creation fee (minimum 0.001 ETH)
4. Submit transaction

### Placing Bets

1. Browse active markets in "Browse Markets" tab
2. Select an outcome by clicking on it
3. Enter bet amount in ETH
4. Click "Place Bet" and confirm transaction

### Resolving Markets (Arbitrators)

1. Only designated arbitrators can vote on market outcomes
2. Markets can only be resolved after the resolution time has passed
3. Each arbitrator casts one vote for what they believe is the correct outcome
4. **Winning Conditions:**
   - Market resolves when any outcome receives majority votes (>50%)
   - If all arbitrators vote but no majority: Market declared a **DRAW**
5. **Draw Scenario:** All bets are refunded minus 2.5% fees

### Withdrawing Winnings

1. After market resolution, winners can withdraw their share
2. Winnings are calculated proportionally based on bet amounts
3. Total fees (2.5%) are deducted: 1.5% platform + 1% arbitrators
4. Go to resolved market and click "Withdraw Winnings"
5. **Draw Markets:** All bettors receive refunds minus fees

### Claiming Arbitrator Fees

1. Arbitrators can claim fees after market is resolved
2. **Eligibility:**
   - For normal resolution: Only arbitrators who voted for the **winning outcome**
   - For draws: All arbitrators who **voted** (any outcome)
   - Non-voters receive nothing
3. Fees are split equally among eligible arbitrators
4. Each arbitrator must claim their own fees by calling `claimArbitratorFee(marketId)`

### Understanding Arbitrator Fees

**How Fees Are Collected:**
- 1% of every winning payout goes to the arbitrator fee pool
- In draw scenarios, 1% of every refund contributes to the pool
- Total collected fees are displayed transparently on resolved markets

**Fee Distribution Rules:**

| Scenario | Who Gets Fees | Split Method |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Normal Win** | Only arbitrators who voted for winning outcome | Equal split among correct voters |
| **Draw** | All arbitrators who voted (any outcome) | Equal split among all voters |
| **No Vote** | No fees earned | N/A |

**Example:**
- Market with 5 arbitrators resolves normally
- Total arbitrator fees collected: 1 ETH
- 3 arbitrators voted correctly ‚Üí Each gets 0.333 ETH
- 2 arbitrators voted wrong or didn't vote ‚Üí Get 0 ETH

**Frontend Display:**
Arbitrators see real-time information on resolved markets:
- ‚úÖ **Eligible & Unclaimed**: Shows fee amount + "Claim" button
- ‚úÖ **Eligible & Claimed**: Shows checkmark + amount claimed
- ‚ùå **Not Eligible**: Explains why (didn't vote or voted incorrectly)
