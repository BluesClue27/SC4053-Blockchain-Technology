## Recommended Testing Setup

### Scenario 1: Basic Testing
- **Market Creator:** Account #0
- **Arbitrators (3 required):** Accounts #1, #2, #3
- **Bidders:** Accounts #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9

### Scenario 2: Multiple Markets
- **Market Creator 1:** Account #0
- **Market Creator 2:** Account #1
- **Arbitrators (3 required):** Accounts #10, #11, #12
- **Bidders:** Accounts #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9

### Scenario 3: Complex Testing (Multiple Markets & Arbitrators)
- **Market Creators:** Accounts #0, #1, #2, #3
- **Arbitrator Set 1:** Accounts #10, #11, #12
- **Arbitrator Set 2:** Accounts #13, #14, #15
- **Bidders:** Accounts #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #16, #17, #18, #19

### Scenario 4: Large-Scale Testing
- **Market Creators:** Accounts #0, #1, #2, #3, #4
- **Arbitrators (3 required per market):** Accounts #10-#19 (can assign different sets)
- **Bidders:** Any combination of accounts #5-#19

## Testing Workflow Example

1. **Import Accounts:**
   - Import at least 4 accounts (1 creator + 3 arbitrators minimum)
   - Optionally import more accounts for bidders

2. **Create a Market:**
   - Switch to Account #0 in MetaMask
   - Go to "Create Market" tab
   - Fill in market details
   - Add at least 3 arbitrator addresses (e.g., Accounts #1, #2, #3)
   - Pay 0.001 ETH creation fee
   - Submit transaction

3. **Place Bets:**
   - Switch to different accounts in MetaMask (e.g., Accounts #4, #5, #6)
   - Browse to the market you created
   - Place bets on different outcomes
   - Each account can bet different amounts

4. **Resolve Market:**
   - Wait until after the resolution time
   - Switch to one of the arbitrator accounts (e.g., Account #1)
   - The arbitrators will vote on the winning outcome
   - Once consensus is reached, the market resolves

5. **Withdraw Winnings:**
   - Switch to an account that bet on the winning outcome
   - Click "Withdraw Winnings" button
   - Receive your proportional share of the pot (minus 2.5% platform fee)

## Security Notes

**⚠️ IMPORTANT - FOR LOCAL TESTING ONLY**

- These private keys are publicly known and should **NEVER** be used on mainnet or public testnets
- These accounts are only for local Hardhat development
- Do not send real ETH or tokens to these addresses
- Anyone with access to these private keys can control these accounts

## Troubleshooting

### "Nonce too high" error
When you restart the local blockchain, MetaMask's transaction history becomes outdated:
1. Open MetaMask → Settings → Advanced
2. Click "Clear activity tab data" or "Reset Account"
3. This resets the nonce for all accounts

### Account balance shows 0 ETH
Make sure:
1. The local blockchain is running (`npm run node`)
2. MetaMask is connected to "Localhost 8545" network (Chain ID: 31337)
3. You've imported the account using the correct private key

### Cannot import account
If you see "This account has already been imported":
- You've already imported this account
- Check your MetaMask account list
- Switch between accounts using the account dropdown
